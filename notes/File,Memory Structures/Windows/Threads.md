Processes are the container for execution, but threads are what the Windows OS executes. Threads are independent sequences of instructions that are executed by the CPU without waiting for other threads

**Thread Context**
When one thread is running, it has complete control of the CPU, or the CPU core, and other threads cannot affect the state of the CPU or core.
