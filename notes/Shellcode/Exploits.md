**Stack overflow vulnerability**

Risk reduced in recent years due to introduction of DEP/NX technique

By passing an argument greater than an allocated buffer size, the
attacker can overwrite all the Buffer space, as well as the EBP and the return address

**Heap Overflow vulnerability**
exactly the same as buffer overflow vulnerabilities, except that they target variables that are allocated using malloc, HeapAlloc, or similar
APIs

The heap does not contain a return address or EBP but all variables are connected via a linked list structure

By overflowing an item in the heap, the attacker can overwrite FLink and BLink, which makes it
possible to write anything at any address.

**Use after free**
This vulnerability occurs when an object (a structure in memory) is still being referenced after it was freed

Stack canaries (/GS Cookies): This technique involves writing a 4 byte value just before the return address that will be checked before executing the ret
instruction.

SafeSEH and SEHOP: These two mitigations directly protect the applications from memory corruptions that overwrite SEH addresses
SEH addresses are no longer stored in the stack and
instead are referenced in the PE header
