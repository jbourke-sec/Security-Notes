RegOpenKeyEx Opens a registry for editing and querying. There are functions
that allow you to query and edit a registry key without opening it
first, but most programs use RegOpenKeyEx anyway.
RegSetValueEx Adds a new value to the registry and sets its data.
RegGetValue Returns the data for a value entry in the registry.
