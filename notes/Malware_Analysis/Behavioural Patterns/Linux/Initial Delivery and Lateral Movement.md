**Default weak credentials:** Unfortunately, many companies manufacturing
devices use very weak default credentials in order to remotely connect to the
devices for maintenance purposes

SSH and Telnet are the top choices of
attackers in terms of the protocols being misused

**Dynamic passwords**: Some companies tried to avoid this situation by using a so-called
password of the day. However, the algorithm is generally easily accessible
as it has to be implemented on the end user device,

**Exploits:** Generally, the process of updating any system may require user interaction to go reliably, which is more troublesome for embedded devices compared to PCs. As a result, as long as some vulnerability becomes known, the list of devices it can affect remains huge over a long period of time.
