This format is the main executable format on macOS and iOS operating systems

**Thin**
This is the most common type of Mach-O files

Header: Contains general information about the file. Here is its structure according to the official source code

The difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of this header is mainly in the extra reserved field added to the end of this structure, and the slightly different magic values used: 0xfeedface for 32-bit and 0xfeedfacf for 64-bit.

Segments: Each segment consists of sections that contain actual code and data.

As each segment starts on the page boundary, its size is a multiple of 4 K

TEXT: This segment is read-only as it contains executable code
and constant data:
__text: Contains actual compiled machine code
__const: Generic constant data used by the
executable
__cstring: Stores string constants
__DATA: This contains non-constant data, so it is available for both
read and write operations:
__data: Used to store initialized global variables
__common: Stores uninitialized external global
variables
__bss: Keeps uninitialized static variables
__const: Contains constant data available for
relocation

The files that implement this format contain machine code associated with one platform only. At the moment, it is ARM for iOS and x86-64 for macOS; older versions of macOS were based on PowerPC and later, IA-32 architectures
