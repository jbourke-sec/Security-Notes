****In C/C++, left shift (<<) and right shift (>>)**** operators are binary bitwise operators that are used to shift the bits either left or right of the first operand by the number of positions specified by the second operand allowing efficient data manipulation

Left shifting a number by `n` positions is equivalent to multiplying it by `2^n` and is much faster than normal multiplication

Bitwise XOR - a ^ b
Bitwise OR - a | b
Bitwise AND - a & b
Bitwise NOT - ~a
