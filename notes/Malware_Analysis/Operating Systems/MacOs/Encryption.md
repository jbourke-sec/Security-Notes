Apple uses its own Apple FileSystem (APFS)
Mac computers are shipped with the FileVault disk encryption system that utilizes the XTS-AES-128 algorithm

possible to encrypt the whole disk and make it accessible only with valid credentials or a recovery key (FileVault 2).

Once the user enables the FileVault feature, it is required to authenticate before using the Target Disk Mode, where a device can be attached to another machine and become accessible as an external device.

the Apple T2 security chip enables
Secure Boot to implement a chain of trust rooted in hardware, where the software integrity is assured at every next step of booting

All Macs are also shipped with the built-in time machine backup feature, which allows you
to restore files once they are lost or damaged

**Data encryption and password management**

Each iOS device has its Unique IDs (UID) and Group IDs (GID) to be used in cryptographic operations

UID is unique to the device 
GID is shared across all processors of the same type

These values are fused or compiled into the Secure Enclave and CPU during manufacturing; each device gets its own values that are not accessible directly by either software, firmware, or through
debugging interfaces

keys are generated inside the Secure
Enclave utilizing a true (not pseudo) hardware random-number generator

This per-file key is then wrapped (encrypted) with the corresponding class key

**Class A—complete protection**: Class keys are wrapped using both an UID and passcode; decrypted keys are discarded after the device is locked.
Class B—protected unless open: Class keys are used together with elliptic curve cryptography to handle files that should be written when the device is locked.
Class C—protected until first user authentication: The default class for all thirdparty apps' data. It's pretty much the same as Class A, but the main difference is that the decrypted class keys are not wiped once the device is locked. This
provides protection against attacks that utilize a reboot.
Class D—no protection: Class keys are encrypted using only the UID. They are stored in the Effaceable Storage and can be quickly wiped if necessary

**Keybags**

all class keys for file protection and keychain are administrated using keybags.
There are several types of them used at the moment in iOS:
User keybag: This stores wrapped class keys involved in the normal device operation.
Device keybag: This stores wrapped class keys associated with device-specific data operations.
Backup keybag: This is used when the encrypted backup is created using iTunes.
iCloud backup: Similar to the backup keybag, it is used for iCloud backups.
Escrow keybag: This is used for iTunes syncing and Mobile Device
Management (MDM).

Saved user passwords are kept in the dedicated storage, called the Password AutoFill keychain. In addition, the iCloud keychain mechanism is responsible for synchronizing credentials across multiple devices
