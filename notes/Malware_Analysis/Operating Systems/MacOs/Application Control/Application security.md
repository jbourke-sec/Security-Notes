iOS requires all code running on the device to be signed using a valid Apple-issued certificate

the sideloading of apps outside the App Store is not supported for
purposes other than app development.

All apps are sandboxed, so they can only access the resources necessary to perform their function. They run under the non-privileged mobile user and there are no APIs that allow
self-privilege escalation

Each app has its own directory to store files and can't gather or
alter information associated with other applications

the apps' extensions (signed executables shipped with the app) can be used for inter-process communications as well; in this case, each extension has its own address
space

The way third-party apps can access sensitive data is controlled by a mechanism called entitlements

These are digitally-signed credentials, associated with apps, for handling privilege operations

this, features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), ARM's Execute Never (XN), and stack canaries are used to provide protection against exploits that leverage memory-corruption vulnerabilities
