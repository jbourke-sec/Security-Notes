It gives users direct control over what apps are allowed to be installed. Thus, it is possible to enforce the policy by allowing only apps from the App Store to be used

All apps aiming to appear on the
App Store should be signed with a certificate issued by Apple and reviewed by its engineers

Default Gatekeeper settings also allow applications from outside the App Store that still have a valid developer ID signature, which means the app is signed using a certificate issued by Apple

In this case, the files are checked by automatic malware scanning and signature checking;

Unsigned applications will be restricted in rights by mandatory access controls.

Another anti-malware feature implemented in Gatekeeper is Path Randomization

When apps appear to be less trustworthy, they are placed to the unknown to their developers system location supporting at most read-only operations. The idea here is to prevent malicious apps
from self-updating and from accessing data using relative paths
