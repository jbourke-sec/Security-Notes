**Data:** This term can be used to refer to a specific section of memory
called the data section, which contains values that are put in place when a program is initially loaded. These values are sometimes called static values because they may not change while the program is running, or they may be called global values because they are available to any part of the
program.
**Code:** Code includes the instructions fetched by the CPU to execute the program’s tasks. The code controls what the program does and
how the program’s tasks will be orchestrated.
**Heap:** The heap is used for dynamic memory during program execution,
to create (allocate) new values and eliminate (free) values that the program no longer needs. The heap is referred to as dynamic memory because its contents can change frequently while the program is running.
**Stack** The stack is used for local variables and parameters for functions, and to help control program flow.
